# FAQ 

## Can I help?

Yes!  I cannot do this alone.  I am a terrible artist so completely depend on viewers for that... but other areas can be a huge help as well.  Anyone is welcome to contribute ideas, code, help test, art, music, ...everything that goes into gamedev.  

You can get as involved as you like.  

Pros:

 - Experience / fun.
 - For your portfolio.
 - Credits in the game itself.
 - If you make a non-trivial contribution, I may be able to return the favor someday in the form of a letter of recommendation (or similar).

Cons:

 - I cannot afford to pay you for your time.  
   - If someday we become profitable, this will change.
 - All your contributions must be submitted with an open-source, free for commercial-use license (such as MIT).
 - Not all contributions will fit the theme or goal of the game, i.e. I cannot promise we'll use your work.

## How-to Help?

If there is something you are considering doing, it may be best to check in with us in chat before you start (in case someone else is on it or to confirm the direction).

To submit there are two options:

 - For subscribers only: 
   - The entire game is available on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/HD-source/TacticalArena). You can submit pull requests like you would for any git project.
     - Connect your account at [collab.hardlydifficult.com](collab.hardlydifficult.com).
     - FYI Subs can view the source for our game and all the projects we work on. This is not 'open source' - for educational purposes or to help with the game, all rights reserved.
     - Please limit the number of files changed, especially scenes and prefabs which typically do not merge well.
 - For anyone: 
   - Submit art and code files via merge requests to [this public repository](https://github.com/hardlydifficult/Submissions).
     - Your changes must be under a folder with your username and include an open source license, such as MIT (template below).
     - Brand new to Git? This [Intro to GIT](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ducmblu3kj3b9x9/2017-04-26_23-18-26.mp4?dl=0) has been recommended.
     - Basic process for submitting:
       - Click 'Fork'.  This creates https://github.com/your-name-here/submissions
       - Click 'Create new File' and create [your twitch name]/license.txt
       - 'Upload files' (or use a Git client) and commit to your master branch.
       - Optionally add a 'credits.txt'.  Include the details (e.g. name/website) that you would want in the credits screen.
       - Click 'New Pull Request'.
         - It should default correctly, but this should create a pull request merging your master branch into my master branch.
         - In the comments describe what changed (if art, maybe include a screenshot).
